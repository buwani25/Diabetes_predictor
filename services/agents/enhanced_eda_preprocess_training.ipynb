    "#### Search Space Design\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rf_param_grid = {\n",
    "    'n_estimators': [200, 300, 400, 500],      # Number of trees\n",

    "#### Advanced Optimization Features\n",
    "- **RandomizedSearchCV**: Efficiently explores hyperparameter space\n",
    "- **Stratified K-Fold CV**: Maintains class balance across folds\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC Scoring**: Optimizes for diabetes prediction performance\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**: Uses all CPU cores for faster training\n",

    "#### Women-Specific Model\n",
    "- Trains exclusively on women's data\n",
    "- **Includes gestational history features** (clinically relevant for women)\n",
    "- Captures female-specific health patterns and pregnancy-related diabetes risk\n",

    "#### Men-Specific Model (Conditional)\n",
    "- Trains exclusively on men's data  \n",
    "- **Excludes gestational history features** (not applicable to males)\n",
    "- Focuses on male-specific health patterns without irrelevant features\n",
    "- Cleaner feature set for improved male diabetes prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comprehensive Metrics\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC**: Primary metric for binary classification performance\n",
    "- **PR-AUC**: Precision-Recall AUC, especially important for imbalanced datasets\n",
    "- **Overfitting Check**: Compares CV score to test score\n",
    "- **Best Parameter Reporting**: Documents optimal hyperparameter combination\n",

    "- Automatically updates `rf_general` and `rf_women` variables with best models\n",
    "- Tracks performance across all trained models\n",
    "- Provides clear feedback on model improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Why Random Forest First?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robust Baseline**: Excellent default performance for tabular data\n",
    "2. **Feature Importance**: Provides interpretable feature rankings for each gender\n",
    "3. **Overfitting Resistance**: Built-in regularization through ensemble averaging\n",
    "4. **Speed vs Performance**: Good balance of training time and accuracy\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Stability**: Relatively insensitive to hyperparameter choices\n",
    "6. **Gender-Specific Insights**: Can identify different important features for men vs women\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🩺 Clinical Benefits of Gender-Specific Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Women's Models**: Capture pregnancy-related diabetes risk (gestational diabetes history)\n",
    "- **Men's Models**: Focus on male-specific risk factors without irrelevant features\n",
    "- **Personalized Medicine**: More accurate risk assessment based on biological differences\n",
    "- **Feature Relevance**: Each model uses only clinically appropriate features\n",

    "\n",
    "#### How Soft Voting Works\n",
    "1. **Individual Predictions**: Each model outputs diabetes probability\n",
    "2. **Probability Averaging**: Combines probabilities using weighted average\n",
    "3. **Final Decision**: Makes prediction based on averaged probabilities\n",
    "4. **Confidence Measure**: Provides calibrated uncertainty estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Medical Benefits\n",
    "- **Conservative Predictions**: Reduces false positives/negatives\n",
    "- **Smooth Probabilities**: Better risk assessment for patients\n",
    "- **Model Diversity**: Combines different algorithmic approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Stacking Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two-Level Learning Architecture\n",
    "```python\n",
    "StackingClassifier(\n",
    "    estimators=[base_models],\n",
    "    final_estimator=LogisticRegression(),\n",
    "    cv=5  # Cross-validation for training\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if ensemble_auc > current_best_auc:\n",
    "    rf_general = best_ensemble_model\n",
    "    print(\"🎉 Ensemble outperforms individual models!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comprehensive Evaluation\n",
    "- **ROC-AUC Comparison**: Primary metric for diabetes prediction\n",
    "- **PR-AUC Analysis**: Important for imbalanced medical datasets\n",
    "- **Statistical Significance**: Robust performance validation\n",
    "- **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance from ensemble components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Conditional Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Management\n",
    "- **Library Dependencies**: Checks for required ensemble libraries\n",
    "- **Computational Resources**: Manages memory and processing time\n",
    "- **Configuration Respect**: Honours `RUN_ENSEMBLE_METHODS` setting\n",
